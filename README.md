# Best Practices

## Endpoints

Controllers should encompass one thing

Sibling endpoints (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE with identical paths) can exist, and must represent the fetching or manipulation of the same concept

A lack of ID specifying that sibling endpoint means all

```ts
@Get()
findAll() {}

@Post()
addMany(@Body body) {}

@Patch()
updateMany(@Body body) {}

@Delete()
deleteMany(@Body body) {}

@Get(':id)
findOne(@Param('id') id: string) {}

@Post(':id)
addOne(@Param('id') id: @Body body) {}

@Patch(':id)
updateOne(@Param('id') id: @Body body) {}

@Delete(':id)
deleteOne(@Param('id') id: string) {}
```

## Parameters

Path parameters should identify a resource
i.e. /phygital/:chainId/:contractAddress/:tokenId identifiers which specific Phygital is being referred to

Query parameters should filter or sort that resource
i.e. /phygital with params `{ chainId, contractAddress, sort }` should filter down to the list of tokens being requested and sort them

Body parameters should specify data being mutated
i.e. /phygitals with a body { chainId, contractAddress, tokenId } should denote adding/updating/deleting that data

All together, if we were updating the name of a container object who returns the complete container after updating, the parameters might look like:

```ts
@Patch('id')
updateContainer(@Param('id') id: string, @Body() body, @Query() query) {
    const { name } = body
    const { sort, filter } = query
    this.service.update(id, name)
    let container = this.service.get(id)
    if (sort) {
        data.entries.sort()
    }
    if (filter) {
        data = data.entries.filter(filter)
    }
    return data
}

```

## Separation of Controllers vs Services

Controllers are the endpoint, where user requests and responses are handled

Services are the meat of the logic, where any interaction with data sources are handled

## Errors

```ts
throw 'Error message';
```

will have a endpoint return a error 500 "Internal server error". The error message thrown will NOT show up.

Better error handling is done by throwing a HttpException(errorMessage, errorCode). For example, a service might throw a:

```ts
throw new HttpException(`Phygital not found`, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
```

Services should be throwing these errors if appropriate, rather than Controllers. This is because the Service knows WHAT went wrong and can better determine what error message to handle. If the service returns default data, the controller will not be able to discern genuine default/empty data cases from handled cases.

## Data Transfer Objects

Data transfer objects (dto) are a way to make sure the request payload has the form needed before making a request.

They should exist within a dto subfolder of their modules' subfolder.

The file is named via "action"-name, such as create-coffee or update-coffee, suffixed with .dto to make it clear what they are.

You can generate one via the CLI:

```
nest g class moduleName/dto/action-name.dto.ts
```

Classes are similar, but in capital case. E.g. ActionNameDto would be the class behind the action-name.dto.ts file

It is best practice to make all the properties of a DTO readonly, as they should not be manipulated.

```ts
export class ActionNameDto {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly brand: string;
  readonly flavours: string[];
}
```

## Validate Input Data

Within DTO's, it's important to validate the incoming data for correctness. This is done via the ValidationPipes.

We configure this during application bootstraping via:

```ts
new ValidationPipe({
  whitelist: true, // Unwanted properties are removed from a dto
  forbidNonWhitelisted: true, // Error 400 if a unwanted property is detected
  transform: true, // Transform body's into a instance of the DTO & transforms simple type casting if needed. Defaults to just matching the form, but not type
}),
```

and can use them within a DTO via attributes such as:

```ts
export class ActionNameDto {
  @IsString()
  readonly name: string;
  @IsString()
  readonly brand: string;
  @IsString({ each: true })
  readonly flavours: string[];
}
```

If the global ValidationPipe has "transform" set to true, @Pipe attributes on Controller methods are unnecesary for simple types.

For example, if you are taking in a id param, usually that defaults to a string and requires a pipe to transform into a int. With the global ValidationPipe having transform enabled, you can just declare the type is a number in the method params and that casting will be done for you. No need to add a additional pipe.

## PartialTypes in DTO

Using PartialType from @nestjs/mapped-types, we can create Dto's that inherit from another Dto, however set all properties to be nullable.

This is useful to patch/update dto's to reduce code duplication. This will inherit validation pipe rules from the parent.

```ts
export class UpdateNameDto extends PartialType(CreateNameDto) {
  @IsNumber()
  id: number;
}
```

## Testing

There are three levels of testing:

### Services

src/name/name.service.spec.ts

### Controllers

src/name/name.controller.spec.ts

### End-to-end

test/name.e2e-spec.ts
